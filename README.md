# Library_Project
This project is developed in Python and provides users with an interface to search for books. In the interface, users can list, add, and remove books. Added books are saved to the database, and deleted ones are removed from the database. These operations allow users to manage their book-related data systematically. SQLite is used for database management.

The core functionalities of the project include:

1. **Adding Books**: Users can add new books to the database by entering information such as the book's title, author, publication date, etc.

2. **Deleting Books**: Users can remove books from the list by selecting the ones they want to delete, thereby removing them from the database.

3. **Listing Books**: Users can view the added books through a list option, displaying details such as the book title, author, publication date, etc.

4. **Database Integration**: Added and deleted books are managed appropriately in the database. The database is utilized to store book information and provide access to this information when needed.

5. **User Interface**: The project provides an interface for users to easily interact with. This interface enables users to add, remove, and list books effortlessly.
